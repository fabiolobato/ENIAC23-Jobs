# What about data science? An analysis of the market based on Job posts

## Abstract

The growing importance of data science in the business landscape is indisputable. Consequently, there is also an increase in job posts related to these rising professions. The automatic analysis of this data can benefit professionals who want to enter this area or seek opportunities in the job market, as well as for universities and companies. In this context, the goal of the present study is to collect and analyze job posts related to data science from different sources using text-mining techniques. To this end, 6,000 job posts were analyzed on the main platforms in the area, such as Indeed, newscientist, efinancialcareers, pharmiweb, among others. The results provide valuable insights into key technologies, behavioral skills, ad sites, and general requirements. The findings of this study have the potential to guide possible updates for the development of technical and interpersonal skills according to labor market trends, helping people looking for relocation on the market and allowing building curricula that are more in line with market demands.
